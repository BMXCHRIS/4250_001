Requirements
Gathering deliverables to figure out what the solution will do.
-	Meet with client to gather the requirements/deliverables
-	Determine what the client wants from this project
-	May consist of a deliverable, usually in the form of a submitted document
-	Determine if any libraries/packages are allowed to be used
-	Categorize between functional and non-functional requirements
-	Determine security requirements
-	Develop a Solution Requirements Specification (SRS)

Design
Laying out the requirements into a process and an outline that would lead the project to completion.
-	Determine the coding language to be used
-	Determine what resources are at hand to figure out if in-house software will need to be developed or if 3rd party software will be needed
-	Will consist of multiple iterations
-	This phase is focused on fulfilling requirements

Implementation
Taking requirements and design and using them to create the solution
-	Beginning of the coding process
-	Create classes that were outlined in the design phase

Test
Ensure the project functions as intended. Iron out any problems/bugs.
-	Capture test cases in test documents to record test history
-	Check for any errors in the solution
-	Match the solution to requirements with traceability matrix

Release
Post the first usable version of the software post-testing for public or client usage.
-	The release product may include notes, README files, and guides for the software/application

Support/Maintenance
Work on finding flaws that were not initially noticed and assist the client.
-	Troubleshooting with the client
-	Assisting the client in using the application
-	Error reporting methods and creating a chain of information that points toward the source of bugs when they occur

Upgrade/Updates
After the software is functioning and live, implement new features to improve upon the existing product without making any huge changes to the core functionality.
-	Propose new ideas that implement a new/unused feature
-	Upgrade user interface to improve usability
-	Improve security
