Bucky Barrels

Bio: Donkey Kong-esque arcade 2D platformer; Bucky is at the top of each level, throwing and initiating projectiles/obstacles that the player needs to overcome.

Proposed Feature Set:
Various levels of difficulty, varying in level design, projectile amount, projectile speed
Leaderboard system that has options for both total score (projectiles and enemies defeated, progress made), as well as a timer for speedrunning
Power-ups for the player to unlock, some ideas include a sword (from Bucky), invincibility, etc.
Levels varying in environment (below deck of a ship, climbing the railings), as well as obstacles (cannons, birds when above deck, landmines)
Touch controls that are designed to be simple & easy to learn; hold on the left side of the screen to move left, right to move right, and swipe up to jump.
Ideally can be played and easily controlled in either portrait or landscape
Sound effects & soundtrack
