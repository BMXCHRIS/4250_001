--Requirements: preconditions - document listing out what the program needs to accomplish
-> initial cost of solution/budget requirements
-> should describe major constraints mandatory which may prevent certain designs 
-> software requirements specifications (SRS)
-> Time constraints 
-> resources/team members
-> Functional/nonfunctional requirements
-> mandatory/optional functionality 
-> brainstorming 
-> atomic requirements

--Design: walking through how requirements are implemented
-> UML diagram/architecture/textual & graphical documentation of how the solution is implemented 
-> High-Level, Mid-Level, Detailed-Level
-> Often done breadth first 
-> How do tests integrate into design to ensure requirements are met
-> Requirements traceability matrix

--Implementation: Taking direction of a given design defining steps to take to produce an end product aligning requirements and design
-> Working Software Solution (must compile) 
-> self-documented code 
-> Requirements Traceability Matrix
-> Updates to the design documents required 
-> Code must be readable, funcitonal, modular
-> Cross platform capabilities (Windows, MacOS, etc.) if needed
-> Code standards must be adhered to
-> 

--Testing: Ways/Methods of making sure a program accomplishes the requirements
-> Test plans borken into test cases
-> Requirements Traceability Matrix
-> Unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, stress testing 

--Release: program/software made available to user/customer
-> Release Scripts
-> Rollback scripts

--Support/Maintenance: the bare minumum support (patches, bug fixes) to keep a system functional
-> Bug fixes covered in release notes updates 
-> ReadMe file 
-> Rollback Scripts
-> For support there is a reporting system for FAQ troubleshooting or user problems 

--Updates/Upgrades: a way to introduce new functionality to a released application/software solution
-> ReadMe file
-> Rollback Scripts
