Requirements
1. Must take two numbers from user input (Mandatory)
2. Verify that user numbers are valid (No null, non-numbers, negatives, decimals, etc)
3. Must add user's inputted numbers into a sum
4. Must have recursive method that removes least significant digit from user sum
5. Must have recursive method that adds the new user sum and least significant digit 
6. Must have endif code in recursive method that sees if user sum is a single digit
7. Must print final results to user

Design
START ---> 1. User inputs two valid numbers ---> 2. User's input numbers are added together ---> 3. Sum is put into recursive method that removes least significant digit and saves version of sum with removed least significant digit
---> 4. Sum and Least Significant Digit together ---> 5. Is sum one digit? (No - Call method to repeat cycle) (Yes - Continue to End) ---> End
