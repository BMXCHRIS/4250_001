Requirements: 
User Validation (Only positive integers)
2 Integers
Recursion
Single Digit Integer at End

Design: 
Take in 2 integers from user
Add the 2 integers together
Take off least significant integer
Add Integer that was taken off to total of the integer before it 
Continue until there is only 1 integer remaining 

Implementation:
Used ChatGPT to help visualize how the real code would look. Still trying to understand what is happening. (Was unable to understand it before class ended)
